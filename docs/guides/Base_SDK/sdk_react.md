!!! note "Brand change"
    Currently, several endpoints and libraries have the name **Dippi** which is now Security Labs (sLabs), and may be read as such, although libraries and endpoints still need to be called as the former.

Welcome to your guide to using [`@dippixyz/base`](https://npm.io/package/@dippixyz/base) consumed directly through ReactJS components. For our suite of plug-and-play front-end components see our guide for [`@dippixyz/react-sdk`](https://npm.io/package/@dippixyz/react-sdk) [here](../Frontend_SDKs/frontend_react.md) üöÄ. Please [contact us](mail:hello@dippi.xyz) if you face any problems implementing!

**Please note the following frequent issues before you begin:**

1. This SDK is written for JS ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to run this on Node version ‚â• 18. This SDK uses fetch as a request manager.
2. The [`@dippixyz/base`](https://npm.io/package/@dippixyz/base) SDK can be used both in your backend or your frontend!
3. Need to keep users in the main site while they sign-up/sign-in? We understand! To enable this for your site and your users we recommend you use the iFrame code provided ahead. Keep in mind you can always choose how to display our site.
4. We have developed a suite of components that are included in [`@dippixyz/react-sdk`](../Frontend_SDKs/frontend_react.md) to help you set up your web3 enabled website: sign up, login, reset password, change password, and signing and sending token transactions (More functionalities coming soon!). _The components in [`@dippixyz/react-sdk`](https://npm.io/package/@dippixyz/react-sdk) are only usable on the frontend._

### Step 1: Getting your API token and Application ID

Go to our site: [client.dippi.xyz](http://client.dippi.xyz/). Once there you must create a project. That project will be loaded with all the necessary configurations to be used as rules when creating wallets for your users.

<!-- ![Create Project](/static/img/site1.png) -->
<!-- Show img /static/img/site1.png -->
  <!-- <img src="/static/img/site1.jpg" alt="Site1" /> -->
<!-- [![Site1](../../static/img/site1.jpg)](../../static/img/site1.jpg) -->

![Site 1](site1.jpg)

You‚Äôll find the following form next:

![Site 2](site2.png)

Here‚Äôs what you need to know about each of the fields:

1. **App name**: Choose any name to identify the application you are registering.
2. **Environments**: Decide if the user wallets will be generated in test net or main net.
3. **Assigned to:** Define the desired chain in which the wallet will be created.
4. **Authentication Type**: Define the type of authentication that will be shown to your users when they signup/sign in with Dippi. They‚Äôll have two options:
   1. Email: the user will receive a confirmation email
   2. SMS : the user will receive a OTP via SMS to confirm their account.
5. **Generate API Token** : This will automatically generate an API Token for your app. You‚Äôll use this API Token in the SDK as the requested credentials.

Example:

![Site 3](site3.png)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Once your project is created you‚Äôll obtain an API Token and Application ID: make sure to store these safely ‚Äîback them up and don‚Äôt lose them!

Note: The `API Token` can‚Äôt be recovered if lost. If you ever lose this, you‚Äôll need to generate a new one. To create a new Token follow this guide: {{link}}

### Step 2: Installation and the button component

Once your `API Token` and `Application ID` are ready you can start using our SDK.

The example provided below assumes that you are using **`React + Typescript`** as a framework for your frontend. **_As mentioned earlier the methods provided by the SDK can also be used in your backend_**.

1. Install the SDK. If you want to view the package in npm, click below:

   [npm: @dippixyz/base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dippixyz/base)

   Open your project‚Äôs terminal and run this command:

   ```sh
   npm i @dippixyz/base
   ```

   1. Once the SDK is installed you can import it this way:

   ```js
   const Dippi = require("@dippixyz/base");
   ```

   1. We recommend creating an environment variable in your project (`.env`) or a separate file where you can store your credentials without exposing them in your code.

      _Assuming you have created a new .env file, you should get the following parameters:_

      ```js
      DIPPI_API_TOKEN = <*YOUR_API_TOKEN*>
      DIPPI_APPLICATION_ID = <*YOUR_APPLICATION_ID*>
      DIPPI_URL = https://api.dippi.xyz
      ```

   **_The `DIPPI_URL` parameter should always be the one in the example above._**

   1. Next we‚Äôll create a new component which will contain the **‚ÄòSign-in with Dippi‚Äô** button.

   _Example: create a new file in your components folder‚Äî_

   `/components/dippi.tsx`

   ```js
   import React, { useState } from "react";
   const Dippi = require("@dippixyz/base");

   function DippiSignin() {
     return (
       <div>
         <button
           style={{
             backgroundColor: "white",
             borderRadius: 5,
             borderColor: "white",
             margin: 4,
             padding: "5px 20px 5px 20px",
             border: 1,
             boxShadow: "1px 2px 4px grey",
           }}
         >
           <img
             src="https://client.dippi.xyz/assets/img/logo.png"
             alt="Dippi Icon"
             style={{ width: 30, marginRight: 4 }}
           />
           <span>
             <strong>Continue with Dippi</strong>
           </span>
         </button>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default DippiSignin;
   ```

   Hooray! Your button should look like this:

   ![Site 4](site4.png)

   **_Bear in mind that this is just the basic component. You can build it up and enhance it with what you learn throughout this tutorial._**

   1. Once the SDK is imported you can create the `DippiClient` with the following settings:

      ```js
      const DippiClient = new Dippi({
        appToken: process.env.DIPPI_API_TOKEN,
        appId: process.env.DIPPI_APPLICATION_ID,
        url: process.env.DIPPI_URL,
        urlReturn: "http://localhost:3002/dippi",
      });
      ```

      **_The `urlReturn` parameter is the URL of your project where the DippiClient will return the responses to your requests._**

   1. Create an asynchronous function called `initClientDippi()` that will be used to initialize the `DippiClient`:

   ```js
   const initClientDippi = async () => {
     const { accessToken } = await DippiClient.auth.login();
     DippiClient.setAuthToken(accessToken);
   };
   ```

   - The **`login()`** function returns an object containing an **`accessToken`** that is assigned to the **`accessToken`** variable. This is achieved by de-structuring the returned object.

   - Next, **`DippiClient.setAuthToken(accessToken)`** is used to set the access token on the Dippi client. This will allow the client to perform authenticated operations later on.

   1. Declare a function called `openIframeDippi()` which will set parameters of the iFrame displayed to the user ‚Äîsuch as size, margins, and other options:

   ```js
   const openIframeDippi = async () => {
     await initClientDippi();
     const { url } = await DippiClient.auth.getUrl();
     const left = (window.innerWidth - 500) / 2;
     const top = (window.innerHeight - 650) / 2;
     const options = `toolbar=0,scrollbars=1,status=1,resizable=1,location=1,menuBar=0,width=500,height=650,top=${top},left=${left}`;
     window.open(url, "childWindow", options);
     localStorage.removeItem("registration_complete");
   };
   ```

   **_Note that `initClientDippi()` is implicit in this method and it will initialize the `DippiClient`. You will then obtain the URL to be displayed in the iFrame through the `getUrl()` method._**

   1. Let‚Äôs add the `openIframeDippi()` to the button in the previously created component. This will be executed with the onClick event.

   ```js
   <button
     onClick={openIframeDippi}
     style={{
       backgroundColor: "white",
       borderRadius: 5,
       borderColor: "white",
       margin: 4,
       padding: "5px 20px 5px 20px",
       border: 1,
       boxShadow: "1px 2px 4px grey",
     }}
   >
     <img
       src="https://client.dippi.xyz/assets/img/logo.png"
       alt="Dippi Icon"
       style={{ width: 30, marginRight: 4 }}
     />
     <span>
       <strong>Continue with Dippi</strong>
     </span>
   </button>
   ```

   Great work! Let‚Äôs test the button and check for the modal. It should look like this:

   ![Site 5](site5.png)

   From this point forward everything becomes user experience: your site/app is ready to onboard and log in users through Dippi üôå

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: The credentials used in this modal **_are NOT_** the ones you used when registering on [client.dippi.xyz](http://client.dippi.xyz/) to create your project. _Again: these are credentials created by the user to be interact with your site._

   Please refer to the users‚Äô side of the process in this guide: {{A user‚Äôs guide to Dippi}}

### Step 3: Managing Component's response

Now that the component is ready, you‚Äôll manage the response obtained from Dippi once the user is done with the process:

1. Are you using the code we provided earlier to set up an iFrame or floating window? Then you must define a `window.addEventListener` which will expect the `window.opener.postMessage` message sent by Dippi

   ```js
   window.addEventListener("message", async (event) => {
     const registration_complete = localStorage.getItem(
       "registration_complete"
     );
     const legit_registration_event_completed =
       event.data.type == "registration_complete" &&
       !registration_complete &&
       event.origin == "https://client.dippi.xyz"; // (1)

     if (legit_registration_event_completed) {
       // Verify that the origin of the event is from our official site.
       localStorage.setItem("registration_complete", "true");

       const { redirectUrl, userId, walletAddress } = event.data;
     }
   });
   ```

   1. :rocket: This verifies that the origin of the event is from our official site.

In `event.data` you should expect an object like this:

```js
{
  redirectUrl: "http://localhost:3002/dippi/success/0x7A61081Afd7354385CbE97c718djnflasb2Bd/cljrqklo0983nrp1bf9zzr1j5";
  type: "registration_complete";
  userId: "cljrqklo0983nrp1bf9zzr1j5";
  walletAddress: "0x7A61081Afd7354385CbE97c718djnflasb2Bd";
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: If you are not using the iFrame (instead obtaining a URL through the `DippiClient.auth.getUrl()` method) and get directed to our site, **_the action you will receive in response will be a redirection to a URL with the following structure:_**

`${returnUrl}/success/${wallet.address}/${userId}`

Where `returnUrl` is the established parameter in the `DippiClient`, followed by `/success` ‚Äîindicating that everything worked to spec: `wallet.address` will be the address for the generated wallet, and `userId` the registered user identifier.

Here‚Äôs how something like that would look like:

```sh
http://localhost:3002/dippi/success/0xa0c903C2756e7ceA093246346C249194701d7805/cljrp5uh30005rp1b3wifc4wr
```

_If an error occurs and you want to handle it, the URL will have the following structure:_

`*${returnUrl}/error/${error}*`

Ready? Extract the second parameter in this case and proceed.

1. You can now obtain the complete user information to register it in your database and assume that their session has been initiated. To do this, define a new asynchronous method called `getUser()` which will obtain the users‚Äô information:

   ```js
   const getUser = async (userId: string) => {
     await initClientDippi();
     const user = await DippiClient.user.getProfile(userId);
     console.log("user :::: >>>", user);
   };
   ```

   In the `window.addEventListener` one must add the call for the `getUser()` function after the `const { redirectUrl, userId, walletAddress } = event.data;` line.

   **_The complete method would look like this:_**

   ```js
   window.addEventListener("message", async (event) => {
     const registration_complete = localStorage.getItem(
       "registration_complete"
     );

     if (
       event.data.type == "registration_complete" &&
       !registration_complete &&
       event.origin == "https://client.dippi.xyz"
     ) {
       // Verify that the origin of the event is from our official site.
       // Save in local storage registration_complete = true
       localStorage.setItem("registration_complete", "true");

       const { redirectUrl, userId, walletAddress } = event.data;
       await getUser(userId); // Add getUser function
     }
   });
   ```

   The `await DippiClient.user.getProfile(userId)` method returns a response like this:

   ```js
   {
     applicationId: "clj68i4fs0001qx1bxyb7abks";
     createdAt: "2023-07-06T17:30:00.277Z";
     email: "victor@dippi.xyz";
     id: "cljrfawno0009rp1bznxl8k2h";
     isActive: true;
     isVerified: true;
     lastLogin: null;
     name: "victor+kjnasdlk2";
     password: "$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$Q3Nrs3SWfCIYoLOnj6fY3Q$or1LYlbWgf3uDfWW+7WrKP9r5D4/43U28eVWhQvS35w";
     phone: "";
     refreshToken: null;
     updatedAt: "2023-07-06T17:30:21.794Z";
   }
   ```

**_Once this information is received, you can use it as necessary in your application to start the users‚Äô session._**

1. The final component would look like this:

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";
const Dippi = require("@dippixyz/base");

function DippiSignin() {
  const DippiClient = new Dippi({
    appToken: process.env.DIPPI_API_TOKEN,
    appId: process.env.DIPPI_APPLICATION_ID,
    url: process.env.DIPPI_URL,
    urlReturn: "http://localhost:3002/dippi",
  });

  const initClientDippi = async () => {
    const { accessToken } = await DippiClient.auth.login();
    DippiClient.setAuthToken(accessToken);
  };

  const openIframeDippi = async () => {
    await initClientDippi();
    const { url } = await DippiClient.auth.getUrl();
    const left = (window.innerWidth - 500) / 2;
    const top = (window.innerHeight - 650) / 2;
    const options = `toolbar=0,scrollbars=1,status=1,resizable=1,location=1,menuBar=0,width=500,height=650,top=${top},left=${left}`;
    window.open(url, "childWindow", options);
    localStorage.removeItem("registration_complete");
  };

  window.addEventListener("message", async (event) => {
    const registration_complete = localStorage.getItem("registration_complete");

    if (
      event.data.type == "registration_complete" &&
      !registration_complete &&
      event.origin == "https://client.dippi.xyz"
    ) {
      // Verify that the origin of the event is from our official site.
      // Save in local storage registration_complete = true
      localStorage.setItem("registration_complete", "true");

      const { redirectUrl, userId, walletAddress } = event.data;
      await getUser(userId);
    }
  });

  const getUser = async (userId: string) => {
    await initClientDippi();
    const user = await DippiClient.user.getProfile(userId);
    console.log("user :::: >>>", user);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        style={{
          backgroundColor: "white",
          borderRadius: 5,
          borderColor: "white",
          margin: 4,
          padding: "5px 20px 5px 20px",
          border: 1,
          boxShadow: "1px 2px 4px grey",
        }}
        onClick={openIframeDippi}
      >
        <img
          src="https://client.dippi.xyz/assets/img/logo.png"
          alt="Dippi Icon"
          style={{ width: 30, marginRight: 4 }}
        />
        <span>
          <strong>Continue with Dippi</strong>
        </span>
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default DippiSignin;
```
